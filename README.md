# Neural processes

A sandbox to play with implementation and uses of neural processes.

Looking to implement:
- [Conditional Nueral Processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01613.pdf)
- [Nueral Processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01622.pdf)
- [Attentive Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05761.pdf)

and will undoubtedly be heavily influenced by the [Deepmind implementation](https://github.com/deepmind/neural-processes).

## Install

```
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```
